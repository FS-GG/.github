# Fixture for scripts/repos-audit.sh — the roster participation audit (ADR-0019 follow-up). Proves
# that a receiver which CALLS the reusable coordination-coherence.yml passes, a receiver that has
# workflows but does NOT call it fails, and a receiver with no workflows at all fails — driving the
# audit against a temp roster and a PATH-shim `gh` that serves canned repo-contents responses. No
# network. Mirrors tests/fsgg-coord/run.sh (gh stub) + tests/repos-registry/run.sh (temp roster).
