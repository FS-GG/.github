# work-roadmap

Burn down a markdown roadmap milestone by milestone. The roadmap—not a project board—is the ledger.

1. Read the complete roadmap and select the next unchecked, dependency-ready milestone.
2. Spawn one fresh disposable worker from current default branch and give it only that milestone.
   During worker setup, interactive/game work must explicitly invoke the `pnext-item` performance-first
   planning gate before implementation begins. A milestone that ships or claims reachable game
   functionality must record `game_functionality: true` and a passing bot-driven headless player
   journey (`.github#2087`) — a bot driving the product through the same control messages a real
   player emits, booted at the product's real entry point, not seeded into a mid-game state. No such
   milestone may reach a `shipReady`-equivalent verdict without it.
3. Give the worker a stable feedback cycle id. It follows the repository's SDD lifecycle and item/PR
   merge discipline and invokes `fs-gg-feedback-report` at every required checkpoint boundary.
4. After the first green implementation/test/evidence loop, have the worker start one fresh independent
   critic. The critic reviews requirements, diff, tests, architecture, and roadmap evidence without
   editing the implementation. The worker repairs blocker/major findings, and the same critic confirms
   them before the worker updates the roadmap and lands the milestone. For a work-roadmap milestone,
   this milestone critique loop owns the review/repair count and supersedes `$pnext-item`'s normal
   three-round cap; all other applicable `$pnext-item` planning, review-evidence, exact-SHA, merge,
   release, and escalation discipline remains in force. Permit at most ten numbered
   repair/confirmation rounds. If round ten remains red, record the terminal human escalation, stop
   the milestone, and never start round eleven or merge.
5. Verify the merge, tests, roadmap checkbox/evidence, release obligations, critique artifact,
   checkpoint state, and schema-v2 report externally. Missing, invalid, or unreadable critique or
   feedback state fails closed.
6. Discard the worker and critic, refresh default branch, re-read the roadmap, and select again.
   Persist a typed cycle envelope beside the roadmap: fresh-read Markdown into its source revision
   and units, run `fsgg-coord cycle inspect`, then `register` (or exact-id resume) for the milestone.
   Bind each unit's stable roadmap feedback/critique identity as `providerCycleId`. Pass the actual
   generated SDD verification, validated schema-v3 critique, and validated schema-v2 feedback artifacts
   to `advance`: each provider input names `rootPath` and `artifactPath`, while feedback also names its
   `auditPath` and ordered `phases`. The engine reruns `fsgg-sdd verify` and the canonical critique and
   feedback validators itself; normalized or minimally shaped caller-authored envelopes are not
   provider evidence, and journey applicability comes from the critique artifact. Persist the
   `updateReceipt` emitted and durably journaled by the guarded merged-head/checkpoint `update`;
   `complete` consumes that exact receipt and revalidates its bound
   evidence, followed by another fresh inspection.
   Parallel milestones additionally require recorded disjoint touch-sets and explicit operator
   authorization. Missing, stale, or wrong-cycle evidence fails closed.
7. After no unchecked milestone remains, validate every completed cycle and land the final report with
   cross-cycle critique and feedback roll-ups; a report that omits a cycle, critique disposition, or
   checkpoint disposition cannot finish.

## Lifecycle log

Create the item's externally durable, digest-chained lifecycle log on its canonical GitHub issue before its first phase transition and append every
phase start, completion, block, and resume. Include numbered critique/repair rounds, guarded landing,
protected-main verification, receipt/projection, and cleanup as distinct phases. Validate the log at each
worker/critic handoff, before host acceptance, before cycle completion, and in the final cross-cycle
roll-up. A missing phase, sequence gap, invalid transition, or unresolved active phase fails closed.

The candidate branch must not be the live authority. Later review, merge, protected-main, projection, and
cleanup events would change the very head they attest and create an infinite review loop. A tracked
`logs/roadmap/` file is only an immutable export made after the covered interval; it never gates its own
candidate head. Raw runtime reports remain private and untracked, while public events retain aggregate
counts plus stable report digests and runtime identifiers.

Record the exact provider/model variant and effort plus runtime, coordination, SDD CLI/contracts, and
ledger-schema versions for each phase, alongside authoritative input, cached
input, cache-write input, output, reasoning, and total token usage. Token accounting is reconciled after
the response finishes from the runtime session record or stable provider response; a terminal phase may
not turn a temporarily unavailable in-turn counter into permanent `unavailable`. When a runtime truly
provides no authoritative record, retain the concrete host/source reason; never infer or estimate. Freeze
one immutable private usage receipt per phase when cited so later appends cannot invalidate prior events.
Collection archives frozen receipts in the canonical per-user content-addressed private store; `/tmp` and
repository-only copies are not retention. Seal, validation, and roll-up resolve by digest. An already-missing
receipt needs a separately reviewed non-counting legacy proof and is excluded, never reconstructed.
Durations and historical averages are derived from recorded UTC timestamps and comparable prior duration
evidence with the same tooling fingerprint, using only whole discrete minutes. Read [lifecycle-log](references/lifecycle-log.md) for the canonical path,
schema, transition rules, token accounting, and exact validation command.

The roadmap driver is the supervising parent for every dispatched worker, critic, confirmation,
recovery, or host phase. A child returns an unposted terminal draft with `pending final usage` plus its
exact session/turn or transcript identity. Only after that child is terminal does the driver harvest the
completed local record, seal and post its measured terminal event, and accept the handoff. The driver
must not interpret “the final count is written after my response” as terminal `unavailable`; host
acceptance, cycle completion, cross-cycle roll-up, and roadmap Done all fail closed while a completed
child lacks post-response reconciliation. A genuine unavailable result requires a documented
post-completion uniqueness lookup or strict-schema failure. Repair an already-posted legacy timing reason
with a distinct telemetry-reconciliation phase rather than editing the immutable event.

For an extraordinary immutable history that neither its creating nor current toolkit can repair, the
accountable human may authorize the first-class synthetic checkpoint described by the lifecycle reference.
The driver binds the proof to the exact item/run/unit and frontier, declares missing provenance is not
required and no data is reconstructed, carries passing functional verification, and appends exactly one
checkpoint phase. Its completion is the new trusted anchor; ordinary strict processing resumes immediately.
Never infer this authority from broad decision latitude or use it without the immutable human authorization.

## Status position line

Every intermediate roadmap-driver, worker, or critic-handoff status reply must start with:

`Roadmap item: **<unit-id> — <name>** · GitHub: <linked owner/repo#number>`

Make the issue label a Markdown hyperlink to its canonical GitHub issue URL.

Follow it with one current, compact, ordered process-position line using:

- `✅` completed
- `🟢` active (exactly one while work is progressing)
- `⚪` pending
- `🔴` blocked (and no `🟢` while blocked)

Name active repair rounds. Show each completed step's actual duration and historical average for that
canonical step; show active elapsed time. Use only whole minutes: floor active elapsed; round completed
actuals and arithmetic averages to nearest. Average prior completed occurrences in this roadmap run,
excluding the current one; use `avg n/a` without a prior observation. Use recorded lifecycle timestamps,
never invented timing evidence. Give each concurrently reported item its own header and position line.

Example:

`✅ Intake (actual 2 min · avg 3 min) → ✅ Claim (actual 1 min · avg n/a) → 🟢 Repair round 3 (active · elapsed 4 min) → ⚪ Host acceptance → ⚪ Guarded merge`

The header and line complement, not replace, prose and evidence.
