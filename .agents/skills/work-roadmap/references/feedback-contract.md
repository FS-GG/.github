# Development-feedback completion gate

The worker must explicitly invoke `fs-gg-feedback-report` and keep one stable lowercase cycle id:
`roadmap-<roadmap-slug>-m<milestone>-<slug>`. Give that id to the worker in its initial brief; do not
derive a different id after work begins.

At onboarding/first build, lifecycle authoring, the first implementation-test-evidence loop, and
verify/ship/PR orchestration, invoke the feedback skill and decide whether a material checkpoint
qualifies. Append qualifying friction, rework, capability gaps, documentation defects, orchestration
failures, and unexpectedly effective patterns with its documented `checkpoint` command. Routine green
commands are not findings. Keep implementation critique in the critique artifact: feedback captures
development-system observations, not product/code review findings. If the critique cycle itself exposes
material workflow friction or an unexpectedly effective pattern, checkpoint that process observation
without duplicating the critic's implementation finding.

Before handoff, finalize one schema-v2 report for the cycle. In §1 include this activation envelope:

```markdown
- **activation:** active
- **phases:** onboarding-first-build, lifecycle-authoring, implementation-test-evidence, verify-ship-pr
- **material events:** <non-negative checkpoint count>
- **zero-event reason:** <n/a, or evidence-based explanation when the count is zero>
```

When the count is non-zero, validate the checkpoint file:

```sh
dotnet fsi .agents/skills/fs-gg-feedback-report/scripts/feedback-tool.fsx -- \
  validate-checkpoints feedback/checkpoints/<cycle-id>.jsonl
```

Always validate the report with its exact actionability audit, then validate the cycle activation
envelope and the same audit/report binding:

```sh
dotnet fsi .agents/skills/fs-gg-feedback-report/scripts/feedback-tool.fsx -- \
  validate feedback/<report>.md --audit feedback/audits/<report-stem>.audit.json
python3 .agents/skills/work-roadmap/scripts/validate-feedback-state.py \
  --root . --cycle <cycle-id> --report feedback/<report>.md \
  --audit feedback/audits/<report-stem>.audit.json \
  --phases onboarding-first-build,lifecycle-authoring,implementation-test-evidence,verify-ship-pr
```

The host repeats all applicable commands against the worker's exact merged paths before accepting the
milestone. A command passes only when the validator itself exits `0`; capture its output, then capture
and test that exit status immediately. For example:

```sh
validation_output="$(python3 .agents/skills/work-roadmap/scripts/validate-feedback-state.py \
  --root . --cycle <cycle-id> --report feedback/<report>.md \
  --audit feedback/audits/<report-stem>.audit.json \
  --phases onboarding-first-build,lifecycle-authoring,implementation-test-evidence,verify-ship-pr)"
validation_status=$?
printf '%s\n' "$validation_output"
[ "$validation_status" -eq 0 ] || exit "$validation_status"
```

Never pipe a validator through `tail`, `tee`, or another command when deciding whether it passed: a
pipeline reports the last element's status, so a validator exit `1` can be replaced by exit `0` and turn
a failed validation into a false pass. An `incomplete` or `unsupported` audit finding is unresolved and blocks actionable handoff.
Missing, unreadable, malformed, wrong-cycle, count-mismatched, unbound-audit, or unvalidated state fails
closed and the host reports the exact path plus the command above that repairs or verifies it.

A zero-event cycle has no checkpoint JSONL: the validated activation envelope proves capture ran at
the named phases and explains why nothing qualified. Do not create a fake defect or positive pattern.
The schema-v2 report remains mandatory.

Before roadmap completion, the host verifies every completed milestone has a validated cycle report,
then lands a final roll-up that names every cycle/report and dispositions every checkpoint as a
structured finding, positive pattern, accepted observation, or deduplicated existing issue. A final
roadmap report without this coverage is incomplete.
